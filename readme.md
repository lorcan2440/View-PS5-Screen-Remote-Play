## Livestream PS5 Gameplay into OpenCV running on PC

#### Requirements:

- PS Remote Play Software: https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/gb/index.html
- PC running Windows with Python installed

#### Steps

I followed the steps in the first 3 minutes only of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNBs8Wgelf0) video, except for the OBS/Streamlabs part.

The steps are:

1. Create a new PSN account ("the second account").
2. While logged into the second account, go to Settings > Users and Accounts > Other > Enable Console Sharing and Offline Play.
3. Switch users (don't log out) back to your main account.
4. Install [PS Remote Play](https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/gb/index.html) on your PC using your platform. Only tested on Windows.
5. Run the PS Remote Play software on your PC and sign into it using the second account.
6. Connect to your PS5 by following the instructions in the app. This can take a few minutes.
7. Press a button on your controller to bring up the "Who's playing?" box - select your main account.
8. To remove the "Remote Play Connected" banner at the top of the screen, on your PS5 main account, go to Settings > System > Language and choose any other language, then change it back to your own language. This seems to be a workaround for a bug rather than an actual feature so this may not be necessary in future.
9. You should now see the live video feed on your PC in PS Remote Play, and be able to play using the controller. Keep the Remote Play window active (*not minimised* - just put it behind whatever other windows you need to look at).
10. In python, install the libraries NumPy, PyWin32 and OpenCV. The pip command is:
    `pip install numpy opencv-python pywin32`
11. Run the python code in `record_window.py`. If all goes well you should see your gameplay live in an OpenCV window. You can of course use this code as a module in your larger project.

The latency is low with PS Remote Play. The resolution depends on your internet connection but is usually pretty good. The frame rate is usually not as high as the source but should be 30+ FPS. It's good enough that you can play even fast-paced games by watching the stream instead of your TV.

You can get even faster processing by using C++ instead of Python. I have provided an equivalent version of the python script here in C++. Installing opencv in C++ requires building the library from scratch however which is not as beginner friendly as python.

Great for computer vision applications (object detection etc).
